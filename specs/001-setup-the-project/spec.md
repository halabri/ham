## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A visitor arrives at the portfolio website and wants to learn about the portfolio owner's skills and experience. They can navigate between a Home page (showing the profile) and a Blog section (currently under development).

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a visitor accesses the website, **When** they view the landing page, **Then** they see a navigation bar with "Home" and "Blog" buttons
2. **Given** a visitor is on any page, **When** they click the "Home" button, **Then** they are taken to the landing page displaying the portfolio owner's profile
3. **Given** a visitor is on any page, **When** they click the "Blog" button, **Then** they are taken to a "coming soon" page
4. **Given** a visitor is on the Home page, **When** they view the content, **Then** they can see the portfolio owner's skills and experience information
5. **Given** a visitor is on the Blog page, **When** they view the content, **Then** they see only a "Coming soon" message with no additional content

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the website is accessed on mobile devices? (Navigation remains as fixed horizontal bar)
- How does the navigation behave when JavaScript is disabled? (Full functionality maintained without JavaScript)
- What should be displayed if profile information is missing? (Hide empty sections completely)
