## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a website visitor, when I navigate to the home page, I want to see a visually striking and professional design with a dark background and glowing visual effects that creates an impressive first impression and enhances the overall user experience.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits the home page, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see a dark-themed background that is visually appealing
2. **Given** a user is viewing the home page, **When** they look at interactive elements, **Then** they see subtle glowing effects that enhance the visual hierarchy
3. **Given** a user accesses the site on any device, **When** they view the home page, **Then** the fancy dark design renders properly and maintains readability
4. **Given** a user with accessibility needs visits the page, **When** they interact with the content, **Then** all text remains readable and contrast ratios meet accessibility standards

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user has reduced motion preferences enabled?
- How does the glowing effect perform on low-end devices?
- How does the dark theme work with different browser settings?
