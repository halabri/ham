# Research: Fancy Glowing Dark Background Home Page

## Performance Optimization for CSS Animations

**Decision**: Use CSS transforms and will-change property for GPU-accelerated animations
**Rationale**: 
- CSS transforms (translate3d, scale) trigger GPU acceleration vs top/left properties
- will-change: transform hints browser to optimize for animations
- requestAnimationFrame for JavaScript-controlled timing ensures 60 FPS
- Particle systems with CSS animations outperform Canvas/WebGL for simple effects

**Alternatives considered**:
- Canvas API: More complex, requires manual frame management
- WebGL/Three.js: Overkill for simple particle effects, larger bundle size
- CSS animations only: Limited control over particle behavior

## Accessibility and Reduced Motion

**Decision**: Implement prefers-reduced-motion CSS media query with graceful degradation
**Rationale**:
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requires respecting user motion preferences
- Static particles with fade effects provide visual interest without motion
- Maintains dark theme benefits while accommodating accessibility needs

**Alternatives considered**:
- Disable all effects: Loses visual impact entirely
- Reduce intensity only: May still trigger vestibular disorders

## Particle System Implementation

**Decision**: CSS-only particle system with pseudo-elements and nth-child selectors
**Rationale**:
- Lightweight implementation with no JavaScript runtime overhead
- Browser-optimized CSS animations
- Easy to control density and timing through CSS variables
- Responsive design through media queries

**Alternatives considered**:
- JavaScript particle libraries: Higher complexity, runtime overhead
- Canvas-based particles: Better for complex behaviors, but overkill here

## Glow Effect Implementation

**Decision**: CSS box-shadow and text-shadow with multiple layers for depth
**Rationale**:
- Multiple shadow layers create more realistic glow effect
- CSS transitions for smooth hover states
- Hardware acceleration with transform properties
- No additional dependencies required

**Alternatives considered**:
- SVG filters: More complex, potential performance issues
- CSS filters: Limited browser support for blur effects

## Dark Theme Color Palette

**Decision**: Near-black (#0a0a0f) background with white/silver (#ffffff, #c0c0c0) accents
**Rationale**:
- High contrast ratios for WCAG compliance (>7:1)
- Near-black reduces eye strain vs pure black
- Silver tones provide sophistication while maintaining readability
- Compatible with existing brand guidelines

**Alternatives considered**:
- Pure black: Can cause halation effects on OLED displays
- Blue-tinted dark: May conflict with existing brand colors
- Gradient backgrounds: Could interfere with content readability

## Responsive Design Strategy

**Decision**: Adaptive particle density based on screen size and device capabilities
**Rationale**:
- Mobile devices get fewer particles to preserve performance
- Use CSS clamp() for scalable glow effects
- matchMedia API to detect device capabilities
- Progressive enhancement approach

**Alternatives considered**:
- Fixed density: Poor performance on mobile
- JavaScript-only detection: Requires runtime overhead
- Device-specific breakpoints: Too many edge cases
