## Quick Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Existing portfolio repository with dark theme implementation

### Development Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies (if new packages added)
npm install

# Start development server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Run tests in watch mode during development
npm test --watch

# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Build for production testing
npm run build
npm start
```

## Component Development Workflow

### 1. Professional Data Setup
```typescript
// src/lib/professional-data.ts
export const professionalProfile: ProfessionalProfile = {
  personalInfo: {
    fullName: "Hisham Alabri",
    title: "Senior Software Engineer",
    tagline: "Java - Spring Boot - React"
  },
  // ... rest of professional data
};
```

### 2. Component Implementation Order
1. **ProfileHeader** - Name, title, contact info
2. **ProfessionalSummary** - Career overview  
3. **SkillsSection** - Technical competencies
4. **ExperienceSection** - Work history
5. **EducationSection** - Academic background
6. **Integration** - Compose all sections in homepage

### 3. Testing Approach
```bash
# Test individual components
npm test ProfileHeader.test.tsx
npm test ProfessionalSummary.test.tsx

# Test integration
npm test HomePage.test.tsx

# Test accessibility  
npm test accessibility/
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Glow effects not applying to professional content
**Solution**: Ensure components are wrapped with existing `GlowEffect` component
```typescript
<GlowEffect intensity="subtle">
  <h1>{personalInfo.fullName}</h1>
</GlowEffect>
```

### Issue: Content interfering with particle background
**Solution**: Verify z-index layering and use proper positioning classes
```css
.professional-content {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 10; /* Above particles but below modals */
}
```

### Issue: Mobile layout breaking
**Solution**: Use TailwindCSS responsive utilities consistently
```typescript
<div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row md:items-center">
```

### Issue: Performance degradation
**Solution**: Ensure static rendering and minimal re-renders
```typescript
// Use useMemo for expensive calculations
const formattedExperience = useMemo(() => 
  formatExperienceData(experiences), [experiences]
);
```

## Success Criteria

The implementation is considered complete when:
- ✅ All professional content displays correctly on homepage
- ✅ Dark theme and animations fully preserved  
- ✅ WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance achieved
- ✅ Responsive design works from 320px to 4K displays
- ✅ Performance metrics maintained or improved
- ✅ All tests passing (component, integration, accessibility)
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility verified
- ✅ Contact functionality working (email, GitHub links)

## Next Steps After Implementation

1. **Content Updates**: Document process for updating professional information
2. **Analytics**: Consider adding view tracking for professional sections
3. **Enhancements**: Plan for future additions (portfolio projects, testimonials)
4. **SEO**: Verify structured data for professional information
5. **Maintenance**: Schedule regular content review and updates
