# Research: Portfolio Homepage Content Update

## Professional Content Integration Research

### Decision: Component-Based Professional Sections
**Rationale**: Integrate professional content using reusable React components that work with the existing dark theme system. Create dedicated components for each professional section (ProfileHeader, ProfessionalSummary, SkillsSection, ExperienceSection, EducationSection) that can leverage existing glow effects and dark theme providers.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Replace existing homepage entirely (rejected: loses existing fancy theme work)
- Single monolithic component (rejected: poor maintainability and reusability)
- Separate professional page (rejected: doesn't meet requirement for homepage integration)

### Decision: CSS-in-JS vs TailwindCSS Extension
**Rationale**: Extend existing TailwindCSS configuration with professional content styling classes while leveraging existing dark theme variables and glow effects. This maintains consistency with the current implementation and performance characteristics.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Styled-components (rejected: adds bundle size, inconsistent with existing approach)
- CSS modules (rejected: doesn't integrate well with existing TailwindCSS setup)
- Inline styles (rejected: poor maintainability and no dark theme integration)

### Decision: Data Management Strategy
**Rationale**: Store professional data in TypeScript constants within a dedicated data file (`src/lib/professional-data.ts`) rather than external CMS or database. This keeps the portfolio lightweight and ensures fast loading while making content updates simple.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Headless CMS (rejected: adds complexity, external dependency for simple static content)
- Database storage (rejected: overkill for static professional information)
- JSON files (rejected: less type-safe than TypeScript constants)

### Decision: Responsive Layout Strategy
**Rationale**: Use CSS Grid and Flexbox with TailwindCSS responsive utilities to create a mobile-first layout that stacks content vertically on small screens and arranges in optimal layouts for larger screens. Leverage existing responsive particle background optimizations.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Fixed desktop layout (rejected: fails constitutional responsive requirement)
- Separate mobile components (rejected: increases maintenance burden)
- CSS media queries only (rejected: TailwindCSS responsive utilities more maintainable)

### Decision: Accessibility Integration
**Rationale**: Implement WCAG 2.1 AA compliance using semantic HTML elements, proper heading hierarchy, ARIA labels, and integration with existing reduced motion preferences. Build on existing accessibility patterns from the dark theme implementation.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Basic accessibility only (rejected: doesn't meet clarified requirements)
- WCAG 2.2 AAA (rejected: excessive for portfolio use case)
- Screen reader testing only (rejected: incomplete accessibility coverage)

### Decision: Performance Integration
**Rationale**: Maintain existing performance benchmarks by using the same optimization techniques (GPU acceleration, reduced motion support, mobile particle optimization) while ensuring new content doesn't impact Web Core Vitals metrics.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Lazy loading professional sections (rejected: content should be immediately visible)
- Separate bundle for professional content (rejected: adds complexity without benefit)
- Image optimization for profile photo (noted: may be relevant for future enhancements)

## Technical Integration Points

### Existing Components to Leverage
- `DarkThemeProvider`: Use for consistent theme context
- `GlowEffect`: Apply to professional headings and key information
- `ParticleBackground`: Preserve as background layer
- Existing TailwindCSS dark theme variables
- Accessibility hooks and reduced motion support

### New Components Required
- `ProfileHeader`: Name, title, contact information with glow effects
- `ProfessionalSummary`: Career overview with dark theme styling
- `SkillsSection`: Categorized technical skills with responsive layout
- `ExperienceSection`: Work history with timeline layout
- `EducationSection`: Academic background

### Integration Challenges
- Ensuring professional content doesn't interfere with particle animations
- Maintaining proper z-index layering for content over particles
- Preserving existing performance characteristics
- Ensuring consistent glow effects across all professional content
- Responsive behavior that works with existing mobile optimizations

## Dependencies and Constraints

### Existing Dependencies to Maintain
- Next.js 15+ App Router structure
- React 19 compiler configuration
- TailwindCSS with custom animation utilities
- TypeScript strict mode
- Jest + React Testing Library setup

### New Dependencies (Minimal)
- None required - leveraging existing technology stack

### Constitutional Compliance
- Component-First Architecture: ✅ Each professional section as reusable component
- Performance-First Development: ✅ No new performance overhead
- Responsive Design: ✅ Mobile-first approach for all professional content
- Type Safety: ✅ TypeScript interfaces for all professional data and components
- SEO & Accessibility: ✅ Semantic HTML and WCAG 2.1 AA compliance planned
